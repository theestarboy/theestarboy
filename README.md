## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Computer Science** student with a strong passion for bridging the gap between deep computing theory and practical, real-world software. While my degree has given me a rigorous foundation in algorithms, memory management, and data structures, I spend my time outside of class actually building systems that solve business problems. 

I don't just write code that passes exams; I write functional applications using Object-Oriented principles, from low-level C++ terminal applications to interactive Java GUIs and responsive web frontends. 

* 🎓 **Currently studying:** Computer Science
* 💼 **Open to:** Software Engineering Internships & Industrial Attachments
* 🌱 **Currently learning:** Advanced software architecture and modern deployment practices
* ⚡ **Fun Fact:** I love taking complex backend logic and turning it into seamless user experiences.
