## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **second-year Computer Science** student with a strong passion for taking what I learn in the classroom and applying it to real-world projects. My coursework is currently giving me a rigorous foundation in algorithms, logic, and data structures, and I spend my free time translating that theory into functional code. 

I am eager to learn how professional software is built and am actively looking for an environment where I can be mentored while contributing to a real engineering team.

* 🎓 **Currently studying:** 2nd Year Computer Science
* 💼 **Open to:** Software Engineering Internships & Industrial Attachments
* 🌱 **Currently learning:** Core data structures, object-oriented design, and building full applications.
* ⚡ **Fun Fact:** I love the challenge of debugging programs!
